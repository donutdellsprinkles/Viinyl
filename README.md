# What is Viinyl?
<img src="Viinyl.png">
Viinyl is a web app which allows you to store sort of past card like images that have text over them. You can then share it to friends and family and you can also revisit the latest Viinyl you created years into the future by just pressing the Viinyl button which will retreive your latest Viinyl.
# Storage
It stores both images and text. Copy paste your image and press the viinyl button and then add some text over the image. Press save to save both the image and text over it.
# Customization
There are currently three different colors of text to use. You can also resize your Viinyl to your liking.
# Viinyl to Link
Lets say you really like the Viinyl you created. Take a screenshot of it and save that screenshot and then go to the Viinyl to link web and insert your image for it to be turned into a link.
You can then convert base64 link into something else. I don't really recommend that as its just a quite a long link and you are better off just using the screenshot.
